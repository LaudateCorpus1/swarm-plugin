= Prometheus Monitoring

== Getting started

The Swarm client has support for https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] monitoring, which can be used to scrape data from a Prometheus server.
To start a Prometheus endpoint, use a non-zero value for the `-prometheusPort` option when starting the client JAR.
The service will be stopped when the Swarm client exits.

The actual metrics can be accessed via the `/prometheus` endpoint.
For example, if the node's IP address is `169.254.10.12`, and `9100` is passed to `-prometheusPort`, then the metrics can be accessed at `http://169.254.10.12:9100/prometheus`.

== Data reported

The client reports metrics for:

* Basic process info, including:
** Process uptime
** CPU time consumed
** Virtual memory consumed
** Resident memory consumed
** File descriptors consumed
* JVM metrics, such as:
** CPU usage
** Memory usage
** Thread states
** Garbage collection statistics
** Class loader statistics
