== Overview

=== Authentication

Swarm may be used with either a https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/[Jenkins API token] (recommended) or a password.
The following command-line options control authentication:

`-username`:: The Jenkins username for authentication.
`-password`:: The Jenkins user API token or password.
`-passwordEnvVariable`:: Environment variable containing the Jenkins user API token or password.
`-passwordFile`:: File containing the Jenkins user API token or password.

NOTE: When using a password, the Swarm client will automatically obtain a valid https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/219257077-CSRF-Protection-Explained[CSRF crumb] when making requests.

=== Authorization

Swarm requires a user with the following permissions:

* *Overall/Read*
* *Agent/Create*
* *Agent/Connect*
* *Agent/Configure* (_not_ required when using the project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy)

== Examples

=== Matrix-based security

A common practice is to grant *Overall/Read* permission to either anonymous or authenticated users, leaving the dedicated Swarm user with only *Agent/Create*, *Agent/Connect*, and *Agent/Configure* permissions:

=== Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy

A common practice is to grant *Overall/Read* permission to either anonymous or authenticated users, leaving the dedicated Swarm user with only *Agent/Create* and *Agent/Connect* permissions:

NOTE: Unlike matrix-based security, the project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy does not require *Agent/Configure* permission.

=== Role-Based Strategy

A common practice is to create a read-only role with *Overall/Read* permission, leaving a dedicated Swarm role with only *Agent/Create*, *Agent/Connect*, and *Agent/Configure* permissions:

The read-only role can then be assigned to either anonymous or authenticated users, leaving the dedicated Swarm role for Swarm users only:
